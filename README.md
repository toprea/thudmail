Thudmail

WHAT IS IT

Thudmail aims to be a gmail-like webmail system.

It is made up of:
- A Rails app providing a REST API around a message store
- an HTML+JS client app that talks to that API
- an email-loader script that can be pointed to by something like .forward or procmail

It is not usable yet.

INSTALLING

- You'll need Rails 3.2.1.  Untested with any other versions.
- Grab the source and run 'rake db:create' / db:migrate / db:seed to bring up the database.
- Run sampledata/import_inbox.sh and sampledata/import_sentmail.sh to import some sample emails.
- Run 'rails server' to start, and hit http://localhost:3000
